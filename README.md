# Binary Search Algorithm Analysis
This project was developed as an assignment for the Algorithm Analysis class at Bahir Dar University. The project focuses on implementing binary search algorithms and provides various functionalities.

Functionalities
Register New Student: Allows the user to register a new student.
View Student List: Displays the list of registered students.
Find Student: Searches for a specific student by ID.
Delete Student: Removes a student from the list.
Delete Minimum ID Student: Deletes the student with the minimum ID from the list.
Delete Maximum ID Student: Deletes the student with the maximum ID from the list.
Number of Registered Students: Displays the total number of students registered.
List of Students in In-Order: Displays the list of students in ascending order of their IDs.
List of Students in Pre-Order: Displays the list of students in pre-order traversal.
List of Students in Post-Order: Displays the list of students in post-order traversal.
Minimum ID Student: Displays the student with the minimum ID.
Maximum ID Student: Displays the student with the maximum ID.
